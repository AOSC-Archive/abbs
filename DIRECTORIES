A Brief Walkthrough of ABBS Source Tree, and More.

1. Walking through the source directory.
   etc		->	basic configuration storage
   libexec	->	executable functions and scriptlets
   params	->	paramenters available for use
   unit-test	->	as in name, unit tests for abbs
   env		->	basic environment definitions
   lib		->	foundational libraries for abbs

2. To properly install abbs (AOSC OS3)
   abbs (the whole checkout)	->	/usr/lib/abbs
   /var/lib/abbs/repo		->	/usr/lib/abbs/repo
					(serves as $ABBS/repo in this case, a symlink)
   /etc/abbs			->	/usr/lib/abbs/etc/abbs
   /etc/abbs/prefix		->	standalone definition setting up abbs' prefix
