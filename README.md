AutoBuild Build Service (AB*BS* )
=================================

ABBS, or AutoBuild Build Service is an upper structure of Autobuild3, intended to provide a way to maintain Autobuild configurations/mainfests in a tree-like manner.

ABBS was first created in concern of future maintenance of AOSC OS and architectural ports. While the multi-architecture support eventually became a feature of Autobuild3, ABBS remain as a tool to aid packagers/distribution maintainers with maintaining a large amount of packages.
